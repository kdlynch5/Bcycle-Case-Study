# Austin Bcycle Case Study

# What is Bcycle?
BCycle is a public bicycle sharing company owned by Trek Bicycle and is based in Waterloo, Wisconsin, United States. It has 34 local systems operating in cities across the United States. Bycycle provides a network of e-bikes (pedal-assist, electric bicycles) that can be rented on-demand from stations located around the city. The process is easy: you go to a station, pick up an e-bike, and go. Then put it away at another station when youâ€™re done. 

# Inspiration for the Project:
As a student at the University of Texas at Austin, I've seen countless students riding bcycles to and from class. As a bcycle customer myself, I came to realize how popular they are amongst students! This led my curiosity towards the impact level student have amongst the business model of Austin Bcycle. Hence, I performed this study to determine if the company benefits or loses money off of student envolvement, and what type of environments are best for bcycle to succeed.
